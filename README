I've included hpmcp's ossh and krb5 implementations, and a krb5.conf that works for arsc. They're the 32-bit versions for linux. If you need something else, go to

https://www.hpcmo.hpc.mil/security/kerberos/

Before running, as root (sudo or su -c or whatever):

cp ./krb5.conf /etc/

From what I can tell, there isn't really a way to specify to kerberos another location for this file. :(

To run everything, ./launcher.sh
