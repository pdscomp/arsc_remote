README.user:  Instructions for OpenSSH client kit
=================================================

Run the  ./install.user  script to install OpenSSH client files:

  ./bin/*  ->  /usr/local/bin/, $HOME/bin/  (or elsewhere in your $PATH)
  ./man/*  ->  /usr/local/man/, $HOME/.ssh/man  (or elsewhere in $MANPATH)
  ./etc/*  ->  $HOME/.ssh/

You may also change $BINDIR, $ETCDIR, and $MANDIR to choose your
own installation directories, or even install everything by hand.

Note that the executables in ./bin have all been modified to use
relative paths.  For example, scp will find the first ssh in your
current $PATH rather than using its normal hardwired absolute path.


Please note that SSH and OpenSSH are *NOT* approved for use with
classified information.
